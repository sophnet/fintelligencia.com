              <p>This is a summary of our new privacy policy which takes effect on March 22nd, 2019. It covers every Finteligencia website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites.</p>
              <p> The <a href="https://www.fintelligencia.com/privacy#long"> detailed policy</a> follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document. Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. </p>
              <p>Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</p>
              <p>Our privacy commitment: Finteligencia has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will. This has been our approach for almost 20 years, and we remain committed to it. This policy tells you what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways partners).</p>
              <p>When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us. We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information. We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.</p>

              <p>We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.</p>
              <p>We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.</p>
        <p>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies from all Finteligencia websites and products.</p>
       <p>We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.</p>
                  <p> The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain). Finteligence undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live. </p>         
                  <p>We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate. </p>
                  <p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online.

<p>Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.</p>
<p>You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums. You can also check our <a href="/security-policy">Security Policy</a> and <a href="/privacy-policy#long">Privacy Policy</a></p>
<p>We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy statement is made by Fintelligence LLC. consisting of all the entities listed here (collectively, "Finteligencia", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 22th March 2018. It applies to all our divisions: Finteligencia, Everpay, Elektropay, and Fundolero.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.</p>
<p>The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>

              <!-- Text -->
              <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Finteligencia websites that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by Finteligencia through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by Finteligencia on Finteligencia’s online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
 
          <h3 class="h5 text-primary font-weight-semi-bold mb-3">This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</h3>
              
<h3 class="h5 font-weight-semi-bold">Part I – Information Finteligencia collects and controls</h3>
<p>This part deals with how Finteligencia collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Finteligencia's products and services, and others who contact Finteligencia through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.</p>
<h3 class="h5 font-weight-semi-bold">Part II – Information that Finteligencia processes on your behalf</h3>
<p>This part deals with how Finteligencia handles data that you entrust to Finteligencia when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.</p>
<h3 class="h5 font-weight-semi-bold">Part III – General</h3>

            </div>
              
<h3 class="h5 text-primary font-weight-semi-bold mb-3">Part I – Information Finteligencia collects and controls</h3>
              <h4 class="h4 font-weight-semi-bold">What information Finteligencia collects</h4>
<p>We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose. Finteligencia will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Finteligencia has automatically collected the information, or (c) Finteligencia has obtained the information from a third party. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.

<p> <u class="font-weight-semi-bold mb-3">Information that you provide us</u></p>
              
<p> <i>i. Account signup : </i> When you sign up for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for information like your name, contact number, email address, company name and country to complete the account signup process. You'll also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing the created account. You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.</p>
<p> <i>ii. Event registrations and other form submissions: </i></p>
      <p> We record information that you submit when you </p>
      <p>(i) register for any event, including webinars or seminars,</p> 
      <p>(ii) subscribe to our newsletter or any other mailing list, </p>
      <p>(iii) submit a form in order to download any product, whitepaper, or other materials, </p>
      <p>(iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, or </p>
      <p>(v) submit a form to request customer support or to contact Finteligencia for any other purpose.</p>
  <p> <i> iii. Payment processing :</i> When you buy something from us, we ask you to provide your name, contact information, and credit card information or other payment account information. When you submit your card information, we store the name and address of the cardholder, the expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number. We do not store the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our Payment Gateway Service Providers.</p>
              <p> <i> iv. Testimonials :</i> When you authorize us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may include your name and other personal information in the testimonial. You will be given an opportunity to review and approve the testimonial before we post it. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@fintelligencia.com
              <p> <i> v. Interactions with Finteligencia :</i> We may record, analyze and use your interactions with us, including email, telephone, and chat conversations with our sales and customer support professionals, for improving our interactions with you and other customers.

      <p>ii.<i>  Information from first party cookies and tracking technologies :</i> We use temporary and permanent cookies to identify users of our services and to enhance user experience.

Information from our reselling partners and service providers :</i> If you contact any of our reselling partners, or otherwise express interest in any of our products or services to them, the reselling partner may pass your name, email address, company name and other information to Finteligencia. If you register for or attend an event that is sponsored by Finteligencia, the event organizer may share your information with us. Finteligencia may also receive information about you from review sites if you comment on any review of our products and services, and from other third-party service providers that we engage for marketing our products and services.</p>
              <p><i> iv. Information from social media sites and other publicly available sources :</i> When you interact or engage with us on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Instagram through posts, comments, questions and other interactions, we may collect such publicly available information, including profile information, to allow us to connect with you, improve our products, or better understand user reactions and issues.

  <p><i>Legal processing bases applicable to Finteligencia </i>: If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for information collection and use depends on the personal information concerned and the context in which we collect it.
